---------------------------------------------------

This is the I/O board for the I/O bus (see specs_IO_bus).

The first 128 I/O ports (00h-7fh) are reserved for internal reZet80 use.
They are divided into 8 regions of 16 ports each by a demultiplexer:

00h-0fh, 10h-1fh, 20h-2fh, 30h-3fh, 40h-4fh, 50h-5fh, 60h-6fh and 70h-7fh.

The 8 regions will be further subdivided on demand.
